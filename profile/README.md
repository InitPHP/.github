## What is InitPHP?

InitPHP is a project that open source develops and publishes various modules/libraries from which you can build large or small structures. The modules here can work completely independently or can be easily used to build a structure that works synchronously with each other.

For example, to write a simple Web API; The [Router](https://github.com/InitPHP/Router) module is sufficient. If you need a query builder or database abstraction layer; Include the [Database](https://github.com/InitPHP/Database) module in your service.
